# Nano 33 IoT as Access Point, PYTHON and QN8066 Controller

This application allows remote control of a transmitter based on the QN8066 through a Python program using a Socket connection. The Arduino sketch for the NANO 33 IoT implements a server that connects to a Wi-Fi network and listens on port 8066. The Python application, in turn, connects to the server or service provided by the NANO 33 IoT and sends configuration commands to the QN8066 transmitter.
