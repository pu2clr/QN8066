# ESP32 WEB ACTIVE PORTAL AND QN8066 FM TRANSMITTER

This application is very similar to the '07_WEB_WIFI_ESP32_QN8066' application, with one subtle difference: the ESP32 itself will provide its own internet network (Access Point), allowing you to configure the FM Transmitter by connecting your device (phone or computer) directly to the ESP32. This eliminates the need for another Wi-Fi network configured in your home or any similar setup.

To use this application, all you need to do is power on the ESP32, connect to the Wi-Fi network with the SSID ESP32_QN8066 (password esp32qn8066) via your computer or mobile device, and start controlling the transmitter through the web page.
