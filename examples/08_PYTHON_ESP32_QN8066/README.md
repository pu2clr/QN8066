# Controlling QN8066 via Python 

This folder contains a Python application that can be run on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS operating systems and allows the user to control a transmitter based on the QN8066. The idea behind this application is similar to the one presented in the "07_WEB_WIFI_CONTROL" folder of this repository, but instead of using a web browser and HTML, this application uses sockets to establish the connection between the client application (Python) and the ESP32.


The ESP32 is an excellent choice for socket-based applications due to its robust networking capabilities, high performance, and ease of integration with Python. Whether you're building a home automation system, a remote control interface, or a data monitoring tool, the combination of ESP32 and Python provides a flexible and powerful solution for IoT and real-time communication projects.
