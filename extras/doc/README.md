## Practical Guide to Building an Inductor Using Copper Wire

To create inductor using copper wire, you can follow a practical approach. The inductance of an inductor depends on factors such as the number of turns, the coil diameter, and the coil length. Here's a basic method to calculate and build your inductor:

### 1. **Inductance formula for an air-core coil:**

\[
L = \frac{(r^2 \cdot N^2)}{9r + 10l}
\]

Where:
- \(L\) is the inductance in microhenries (\(\mu H\)),
- \(r\) is the radius of the coil in inches,
- \(N\) is the number of turns,
- \(l\) is the length of the coil in inches.

### 2. **Determine the wire and coil form:**
- **Choose the wire diameter**: Thin wire, like enameled copper wire (22 AWG or 24 AWG), is recommended for winding small coils.
- **Coil radius**: Choose a cylindrical object with the desired diameter (e.g., a pen or a screw) to use as a mold.

### 3. **Choose approximate dimensions:**
For such a small inductance, you can try a **radius of 3 to 5 mm (0.12 to 0.2 inches)** and a low number of turns.

### 4. **Experimental adjustment:**
Building such small inductors often requires fine adjustments. The final inductance can vary depending on how tightly the wire is wound and other factors like tension.

### 5. **Tools to measure inductance:**
Use an inductance meter (LCR meter) to check the inductance value. If you donâ€™t reach 150 nH initially, you can adjust the number of turns or the coil diameter.

### Practical Example:
- If you use a mold with a **5 mm diameter** (0.2 inches) and wind about **5 to 7 turns**, you should be close to achieving a 150 nH inductance.

You can also simulate these parameters using an online inductor calculator or make experimental adjustments based on your measurements.
